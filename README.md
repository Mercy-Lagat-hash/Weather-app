This project provides comprehensive location and weather information for a specified city. It presents data in a clear and easily understandable format, eliminating the need for users to interpret raw data.

**How to Run**

To execute the program, open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the weather.java file. Then, run the program by typing  _weather.java_ followed by the name of the city and the zipcode resepctfully enclosed in double quotation marks. 

For example : 
 
 $weather.java "Williamstown" " 01267".

The following are what the user should expect to get: 
1. longitude
2. Latitude
3. Humidity 
4. Pressure
5. How the sky looks like
6. Temperature 
7. The sea and ground level
8. Visibility 

-Ultimately the user will be given the advice on whether to keep warm or not.
