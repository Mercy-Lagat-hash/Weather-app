Getting accurate weather information for a specific location can be challenging, especially remotely. While temperature is readily available, other crucial details like cloud cover, visibility, humidity, and air pressure are often less precise in standard weather apps, making it difficult to form a complete picture.  Furthermore, understanding the geographical context of a location relative to one's own can be valuable. This project aims to provide comprehensive information to address these needs.

Users will input the name of the desired location and its zip code. The zip code is essential for accurate identification, as many cities and towns share the same name.

This project will leverage the OpenWeather API to retrieve detailed weather and location data.  The API documentation can be found here: https://www.postman.com/api-evangelist/openweathermap/documentation/muem9d9/openweathermap

The project will be developed using Java. Java was chosen for its ease of execution and platform independence, avoiding the need for specialized environments often associated with languages like Python.
